Step 1 - On GITHUB

Go to Github.com
    Create account
    Create new repository (for free account always public repo)
    copy Link created for repository (e.g. https://github.com/MonishGit/RobotFramework.git)

    RobotFramework


Step 2 - On local Machine
    Download git bash
    configure username and email address (git config --global user.name "MonishGit" and git config --global user.email "pawarmonish@gmail.com"
    Create Local repository
        open Git and create one folder where you want to save your project
        Save automation work in that folder
        All Saved files  will be  in Untrack status initially
        Convert untrack state to Stage by using command "git add "file name" OR git add .
        Convert Stage status to Track files (only after this you can commit)
        Convert Staged file back to Untrack - git reset HEAD "file name"
       -  Add Commit - git commit -m "add your message here"
       -  Convert untrack state to Stage by using command "git add "file name" OR git add .
       -  Convert Stage status to Track files (only after this you can commit)
       -  Add Commit - git commit -m "add your message here"
	   -  Convert Staged file back to Untrack - git reset HEAD FILE NAME
	   -  Check all changes done in fiels "git dif FILE NAME"
	   -  Revert all changes done for specific File "git checkout FILE NAME"

Step 3 - Linkage between Local repository(Git) and Remot repository(Git HUB)
        - check if you have remote repository already  "git remote --v" this will show no response if no remote repository located
        - Link remote repository - "git remote add origin "Link copied in step1"
	

Step 4 - Push code on Master branch ("git push origin master")

Step 5 (for other users) - Clone repository
                         - Create new work location in new user matchine
                         - navigate to that folder and clone repo "git clone "URL noted in step 1"




 *** Running code in Jenkin itself
Step 1 - Create Batch files
            Open notepad enter all libraris you want to run as a part of code along with pip install command
                e.g. pip install robotframework
                     pip install robotframework-SeleniumLibrary
                     pip install robotframework-requests

                Save your file in .bat extention e.g. lib.bat

            - Setup Driver - This is required to run your test case on diff platform e.g. chrome driver for web test, appium for mobile
                             Go to Python2.7>Script copy chromedriver.exe - create folder "driver" in project and paste .exe
